Run multiple containers, starting with 2

Need to modify:
  - Modify timer so that it can react to several alarms
  - Modify evaluator to add spawn secure, case 9 (CAM.c)
  - Either modify evaluator, or launch two concurrent ones
  - vmc_init is hard coded for container one. Make it able to initialize multiple containers
  - think about inter-container message-passing/scheduling
  - figure out how to schedule the evaluation of multiple containers
  - perhaps have a scheduler per container
